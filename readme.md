# Online Transcript Processing System - OTPS
This is a degree project of a student in Imo State University University Owerri Computer Science.
It captures all the major aspects of a Transcript Processing System. Registration, Online payment and application.
When this is done, the admin - schedule officer as the case maybe, compiles the student results if not yet done, inputs them into the portal and marks it as done. Then the student goes on to download student copy while the school forwards the original copy to the institution that required it.
